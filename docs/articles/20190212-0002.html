        <p>What shall I write?<br>Anyway, <strong>I am poor at English</strong>, so I can not write it for too long.</p>
        <p>Let's also talk about the parents' cats.</p>

        <p>It is not cute at all. In the first place she is looking down on me.</p>
        <p>There are many people who say cats are "cute", but I personally think that they are different.<br>If cats have a good point, the cats themselves are "<strong>free</strong>" and "<strong>peaceful</strong>".</p>
        <p>Freedom and peace are good things. Therefore, I think that it is healed by seeing a cat stupidly. It is regrettable!</p>
        <h2 id="write-a-sentence-about-programming">Write a sentence about programming<a class="ubw-heading-slug" aria-hidden data-ubw-autolink href="#write-a-sentence-about-programming">#</a></h2>
        <p>I do not know much about programming too.<br>This command is made with Node.js, so let's talk about it.</p>
        <p>I did not know how to generate the relative path of the URL, so this time I wrote like the following code.</p>
        <pre><code>export function toRelativeUrl(fromPath: string, toPath: string): string {
  // NOTICE: Originally `path.relative()` should not be used for URLs.
  //         In this time, there is probably no inconsistency, so there is no problem.
  const relativeDir = path.relative(
    path.dirname('.' + fromPath),
    path.dirname('.' + toPath)
  );
  return path.join(relativeDir, path.basename(toPath));
}
</code></pre>
        <p>How do you usually write?</p>
