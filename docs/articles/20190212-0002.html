      <h1>A Sample Article</h1>
      <h2>Write a diary</h2>
      <p>What shall I write?<br>Anyway, <strong>I am poor at English</strong>, so I can not write it for too long.</p>
      <p>Let's also talk about the parents' cats.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="../external-resources/cat.jpg" alt="My boss">
      </p>
      <p>It is not cute at all. In the first place she is looking down on me.</p>
      <p>There are many people who say cats are "cute", but I personally think that they are different.<br>If cats have a good point, the cats themselves are "<strong>free</strong>" and "<strong>peaceful</strong>".</p>
      <p>Freedom and peace are good things. Therefore, I think that it is healed by seeing a cat stupidly. It is regrettable!</p>
      <h2>Write a sentence about programming</h2>
      <p>What to do now? I do not know much about programming too.<br>This command is made with Node.js, so let's talk about it.</p>
      <p>I did not know how to generate the relative path of the URL, so this time I wrote the following code in <code>src/utils.ts</code></p>
      <pre><code>export function permalinksToRelativeUrl(fromPermalink: string, toPermalink: string): string {
  // NOTICE: Originally `path.relative()` should not be used for URLs.
  //         In this time, there is probably no inconsistency, so there is no problem.
  const relativeDir = path.relative(
    path.dirname('.' + fromPermalink),
    path.dirname('.' + toPermalink)
  );
  return path.join(relativeDir, path.basename(toPermalink));
}
</code></pre>
      <p>How do you usually write?</p>
