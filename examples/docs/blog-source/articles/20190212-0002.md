# A Sample Article
## Write a diary

What shall I write?  
Anyway, **I am poor at English**, so I can not write it for too long.

Let's also talk about the parents' cats.

![My boss](../external-resources/cat.jpg)

It is not cute at all. In the first place she is looking down on me.

There are many people who say cats are "cute", but I personally think that they are different.  
If cats have a good point, the cats themselves are "__free__" and "__peaceful__".

Freedom and peace are good things. Therefore, I think that it is healed by seeing a cat stupidly. It is regrettable!

## Write a sentence about programming

I do not know much about programming too.  
This command is made with Node.js, so let's talk about it.

I did not know how to generate the relative path of the URL, so this time I wrote like the following code.

```
export function toRelativeUrl(fromPath: string, toPath: string): string {
  // NOTICE: Originally `path.relative()` should not be used for URLs.
  //         In this time, there is probably no inconsistency, so there is no problem.
  const relativeDir = path.relative(
    path.dirname('.' + fromPath),
    path.dirname('.' + toPath)
  );
  return path.join(relativeDir, path.basename(toPath));
}
```

How do you usually write?
